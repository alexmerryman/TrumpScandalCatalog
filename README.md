# Trump Scandal Database

An interactive & searchable database of all of Donald Trump's scandals.

Data sourced from: Lest We Forget the Horrors: A Catalog of Trumpâ€™s Worst Cruelties, Collusions, Corruptions, and Crimes, by John McMurtrie, Ben Parker, Stephanie Steinbrecher, Kelsey Ronan, Amy Sumerton, Rachel Villa, and Sophia DuRose.

------------------------------------

In an effort to improve on the excellent reporting done by the aforementioned, I scraped McSweeney's catalog data and made it filterable & searchable here.

Please keep in mind, this is still very much a work in progress, and will be updated as new scandals/reporting emerge. Additionally, I am working on extending functionality such as providing enhanced filtering, metrics, and analytics such as frequently-appearing entities and themes.
