(herbert hoover actually spoke at an eleventh-grade level; factbase’s study didn’t analyze any president from before 1929.) the fourth-grade competency discovered by frischling resonated with another review nearly three years earlier conducted by the boston globe. the globe had analyzed the verbal fluency of all presidential candidates based on their statements during presidential debates. their review determined trump’s language was the least sophisticated of all 19 candidates—including both democrats and republicans. mirroring the results of the factbase study in 2018, trump’s verbal fluency during 2015 presidential debates equaled that of a fourth grader.",[]
